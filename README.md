# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
Using Python, we will write a script to help automate the auditing process for the Colorado Board of Election of recent local congressional election results.

## Election Audit Results:
Our analysis of the election results shows that:
* There were a total of 369,711 votes cast among the Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties.
* The county with the largest turnout was Denver county, with 306,055 votes, accounting for 82.8% of the total votes cast
* The candidates and their results in this election were:
  * Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes
  * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes
  * Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes
* The winner of the election was:<br/>
**Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes**

## Election Audit Summary:
This Python script can be used to audit any future election results where County and Candidate information is collected along with ballot ID.  With some modification to the script, we can analyze election results with further details such as the type of ballot being cast for the whole election and for each candidate.  It may also be interesting to look at the sex and age of the voter for the whole election and for each candidate.
